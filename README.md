## Tiddlylink

A scratchpad for cleaning & gathering links.

## How to use Tiddlylink

- Paste a link into the input.
- The cleaned version of the link will appear in the History area below the input. This cleaned version has all query parameters removed (anything after a `?`).
- In case you realize you need some of those query parameters, the original link is saved as well. Use the Switch button (first button to the right of each saved link) to switch between the original and the cleaned version of the link.
- Use the Copy button (second button to the right of each saved link) to copy to your clipboard whichever version of the link is currently displayed.
- Don't close the window until you're done with the links you've entered. Link history is saved **only for the current window** and will disappear when the window is closed. There are is no persistent history. This is a scratchpad to get your links together and clean them up before copying them to wherever you're using them.
